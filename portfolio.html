                    <p>This is my thesis project at the University of Miami! I made an animation to explain the immigration story of early Chinese Americans through Illustrator and After Effects. Then I added a timeline to illustrate important events after American Civil War. To show their current life in the United States, I created various charts and graphics to demonstrate the population distribution in each state, the percentage of different groups of visas held by Chinese Americans, as well as the remittance flows between China and other regions. </p>

                    <p>This project idea came with a documentary I did on kids with special needs. There is a timeline to show important steps our society achieved on Autism syndrome. I used D3 library to generate interactive graphics while illustrating the prevalence, types, and the ratios of race and gender of this syndrome. In addition, I also focused on the financial burden of families with autism children as I found family members had to invest large amounts of money and provided meticulous care for autistic kid when I spend time with my documentary subjects.</p>

                  <p>This is a project I worked for my infographic class. My task was to redesign graphics and found more data based on a report published in New York Times. To find a better way to display these data and enhance the readability, I only retained important paragraphs and emphasized on the expenditure of every process during a colposcopy and the percentage of patient numbers from different types of groups.</p>

                    <p>This infographic is taking about beef consumption and Climate Change. I chose New York Times as my client and decided to explain how meat production and climate change are related. To narrow down the topic, I focused on the amounts of different kinds of meat consumed in the United States compared to other major countries and the sources of emissions from beef production. I also analyzed the pollution produced during the process of raising, processing, transporting and cooking livestock products. </p>

                    <p>This website built in quadrigram with hundreds of static graphics created in illustrator. I used the data on the SwiftKey Emoji Report to demonstrate the way people from different backgrounds play emoji in their daily life and some exciting findings about emoji that most people did not know. Some data may seem unbelievable but it is really a lovely project! </p>

                  <p>This is a group project under the supervision of professor Alberto Cairo from School of Communication and Professor Neil Hammerschlag from Rosenstiel Marine School. My team members and I developed scientific explanations on the white shark predation behavior. My role in this project was to build a 3D model of white Shark. We finished the 3D animation in Maya and built the website with a software named Tumult Hype.  </p>

Alice is the oldest student in this studio but still keeps having three ballet classes and two yoga classes each week even she is 91 years old.  </p>
