          <p>“I wanted to be a journalist like you,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/graffsharon" >Sharon Graff-Radell</a> said, laughing and running her hands through her blond hair. “My first job was working at <a href="http://kplr11.com/" > KPLR-TV </a> in St. Louis. I was a writer and producer at the Promotion Department.” </p>
          <p>Sharon, 52, is Director of <a href="https://www.tlcforkids.com/" >TLC Family Care</a>, one of the first nanny and childcare agencies in the United States. She founded the company with her sister Stephanie at the age of 22, one year after her graduation.</p>
          <p>When Radell was a college student, she wrote a thesis on working women in the 1980s, a period of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism">second-wave feminism</a> . At that time, educated women in the United States started to make job gains in white-collar professions. They became doctors, lawyers, managers and CEOs. The rise of a woman’s status in the workforce in this country made Radell realize that there should be some infrastructure to facilitate women’s responsibilities at home.</p>
          <p>“Generations ago, people had their family around, their mothers, grandmothers and everybody was there to help them,” she said. “But in this day and age, people are all over the place. They don’t have the support they need, or their grandparents are working.”</p>

      <h2>Go with your gut instinct</h2>
          <p>Radell graduated from college in 1984, and the idea of TLC germinated when she was at the TV station. She said, “I just had these strong feelings that ‘God, something that needed to be done.’ The next day I started to figure out how to do this business. It was exciting because I was the pioneer in this country, nobody was doing it.”
          <p>In 1985, TLC was born, and Radell received hundreds of requests for nannies within a month. During an hour talk with Radell, her phone rang nearly every ten minutes. “I am sorry, I will have a meeting at 3 p.m.,” she apologized. </p>
          <p>She credits her success to her husband Gregg Radell, who has always been an adviser in her career, and her sister who is also a partner in the company. </p>

          <p class="cap"> Sharon Radell with her husband Greff Radell, an adviser in her business. He also provides technical helps in TLC. “Sharon is a driven, dynamic, caring, brilliant and sensitive person,” Greff said. </p>
          <p>“There have been times when the children were annoyed because she was constantly drawn back to her work or delayed in family activities because of work emergencies,” Gregg said. “But based on the results I see in our now grown children, the family got the attention it needed to grow, thrive, and maintain a strong love within our family structure.”</p>
          <p>“Sharon is a good boss,” her assistant Adriama Zergara, a music major student who studies at Miami Dade College, said. “After my graduation, I will be a full-time assistant for her.”</p>

          <p>“You can do whatever you want if you have the right idea for your career, and you feel confident,” Radell said. “There is no reason that a woman cannot accomplish whatever she wants.”</p>
      <h2>A battle you can win</h2>
          <p>When Radell believed she would be blessed with fortune and happiness, life played a cruel joke on her. In 2005, she was diagnosed with href=""<a href="https://www.cancer.org/fightbreastcancer">breast cancer</a>.</p>
          <p>When Radell first called her doctor and asked for the results of her recent breast cancer screening, her doctor said, “It is clear, everything is fine.”</p>
          <p>Radell was relaxed and began to pick up her children. An hour later, her cell phone rang. “I probably shouldn’t answer the phone,” Radell said. </p>
          <p>The nurse told her in a very apologetic tone that they gave the wrong information, and she should make an appointment with an oncologist.</p>
          <p>Radell pulled over her car and started to cry and scream.</p>
          <p>Her eight-year-old daughter and ten-year-old son were in the car, watching their mother burst into tears. But the kids were still at an age that they didn’t know what cancer was.</p>
          <p>“I was scared; I was terrified,” Radell said. “I was definitely terrified. But once it was out of me, I was fine.”</p>
          <p>In her early 20s, she lost a good friend because of breast cancer. But she never thought this would happen to her because she had gone through life feeling invincible and always having a blue sky over her head.</p>
          <p>As soon as Radell was diagnosed with breast cancer, she decided to have a mastectomy in an early stage, without any hesitation. However, when the day of her surgery came, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina">Hurricane Katrina </a> swept through Florida and the surgery had to be canceled. </p>
          <p>That was the longest two weeks of her life and she had to think about the type of surgery again, whether she needed to remove one breast or two. Radell decided to do a test called <a href="http://www.oncotypedx.com/">oncotype</a>, which can check for the possibility of her cancer recurrence. It was a new technology at that time. At the end, she had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy">mastectomy</a>. Now, she has been cancer free for 10 years.</p>
          <p>“I was scared, but I have never thought that I was going to quit my job,” she said. “I never thought the breast cancer was the end of me. I just thought it was a medical problem that I needed to take care of very quickly because people are counting on me.”</p>
          <p>“My first thought was that if anyone could beat this, Sharon could,” her husband said. “I was certain that we would prevail and refused to consider the consequences otherwise.”
            Radell describes her experience of struggles and triumphs with cancer as a journey. During this journey, she met many women with the same experience. One of these friends who helped Radell go through her journey lost her battle with breast cancer and passed away several years ago. “I was very sad,” she said. “I think about her all the time, I think about her children, her husband and what they must feel right now.”</p>

      <h2>Do not stress yourself too much</h2>
          <p>Radell’s house is adorned with brightly colored furniture and ornaments. Different kinds of interior decorations make the house look very homey and comfortable. Her daughter’s paintings hang all around the dining room. A brown cat jumps into her arm, trying to find the most confortable place for a nap.</p>
          <p>Now, Radell is concerned more about her daughter, <a href="http://wcis.mdc.edu/nwsaweb/va/alumni/caroline_radell">Caroline Faye Radell</a> , who is a fine arts and pre-med major at <a href="http://wustl.edu/"> Washington University in St. Louis</a></p>.

          <p>“She is a talented artist, but she wants to be a doctor,” Radell said. “So, she is deeply stressed. I told her that ‘you have to put your life first, and you should care about your family, friends, relaxing and enjoying, you don’t need to be perfect.’”</p>
          <p>Various factors can contribute to breast cancer, but Radell thinks it is the stress that caused her cancer. When she started to run the company, she was anxious about building a website for the company and spent much time on it.</p>
          <p>Looking back on all the turns and twists in her life, Radell suggests that the most important thing for a woman is to do what you love and do what you are good at, not what you think that you should be doing.</p>

            </div>
              <img src="pictures/james1.jpg" class="img5" alt="Selris james" />
            <p class="cap">Selris James is holding a portrait of his mother, Gwenie Gomez-James.</p>
            <p>One month ago, James had to put his face closely to a canvas while painting a portrait of his mother. But now, he can see his mother in the distance and paint her with ease.
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/selrisjamesfund"> Selris James</a> , 41, is an artist from Trinidad and Tobago. His mother, Gwenie Gomez-James, contracted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella"> rubella </a> during her pregnancy, which led to James being deaf and partially blind.</p>
            <p>In August 2015, James’s mother brought him to the United States for his medical treatment at the invitation of
                <a href="http://education.miami.edu/facultystaff/faculty_bio.asp?ID=33"> Elizabeth G. Harry</a>, James’s former teacher in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago"> Trinidad and Tobago </a>. She is currently a special education professor at the University of Miami.</p>
                <p>After James and his mother had arrived at Miami with donations raised by the<a href="http://tinyurl.com/helpselrisfund"> Selris James Fund</a> , Professor Harry spared no efforts to contact doctors at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and persuade them to offer James free surgery. </p>
              <img src="pictures/james5.jpg" class="img6" alt="Dr. Amescua" />
            <p class="cap">Selris James, (right), gives his painting of Bascom Palmer Eye Institute as a gift to Dr. Amescua, who helped him recover his sight.</p>
            <p>“Bascom Palmer Eye Institute is the No.1 eye institute in the United States,” Professor Harry said. “I did a lot of work. I talked to a doctor I knew there, he talked to his friend and his friend talked to somebody else. Ultimately, we were referred to a doctor who said he would treat him for free.” </p>
            <p>On Oct. 13, 2015, <a href="http://uhealthsystem.com/doctors/profile/95398"> Dr. Guillermo Amescua</a> , a cornea specialist who works at <a href="http://bascompalmer.org/"> Bascom Palmer Eye Institute </a> at the University of Miami, performed a sight-restoring cataract surgery on James. </p>
            <p>"When you have congenital rubella syndrome, that explains why he's deaf,” Dr. Amescua said to a reporter from Channel Seven News. “There's also damage to the retina. Light gets to the retina, but it is not processing it in the same quality as an average patient because his retina is suffering from the infection."</p>
            <p>For the first two days after James had the surgery, he stayed quietly in the bed without any vision. But the next day, when James realized that he could see with his right eye, he became very excited. “All along we went to the art class in the afternoon,” Professor Harry said. “He told the teacher and everybody that he could see and kept pointing his fingers to his eyes to tell others that he has two eyes that could now see.”</p>
            <p>“I am really glad that my big brother’s eye surgery was successful,” Jovita James, Selris’s sister, wrote on Facebook.</p>
            <p>“People should learn from him,” Dr. Amescua said. “With very little vision he did a lot as a kid, and now he's going to have the potential to explore his artistic abilities.”</p>
            <p>After James’s eye surgery was completed, Professor Harry arranged communication therapy for James at UM. Now, James has been learning sign language from a therapist at the university’s School of Education for several weeks. When I saw him at Professor Harry’s office, he couldn’t wait to sign his name through a series of gestures for me. Also, he tries to speak through an app on iPad. </p>

            <p>His eyesight can never be perfectly recovered, but for James, getting an opportunity to see the beauty of the world and present it in his paintings is the best gift of life for him. </p>
        <h1>A Blind Artist Who Harvests Dreams and Love</h1>
          <p>In the eyes of Professor Harry, James is a unique and bright artist. Intelligent as he is, disabilities have inhibited his road to pursue knowledge.</p>
          <p>When he was four years old, James became a big fan of <a href="http://www.sesamestreet.org/"> Sesame Street </a>, an American TV program that educates children through content and animations. Through this program, he learned the letters of the alphabet by himself. </p>
          <p>At the age of seven, he was old enough to enter school. However, it was a headache for his mother. “The school for the blind wouldn’t take him because he was also deaf,” Professor Harry said. “The school for the deaf wouldn’t take him because he was blind.”</p>
          <p>Finally, he enrolled in the Immortelle Children’s Center in Trinidad, a school that Professor Harry had opened for disabled children. At that time, Professor Harry realized that James didn’t like science class and felt lonely because he had no friends. </p>
          <p>Five years later, school officials in New York City and Boston considered James as a gifted child in art and James was granted a partial scholarship to attend the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston, the oldest school that provides the blind with education and skills they need to realize their dreams and goals. Unfortunately, James had to give up the opportunity due to insufficient funding.</p>
          <p>While visiting New York, James drew amazing pictures of buildings and skyscrapers with his weak sight. His teacher and mother were surprised with these pictures because even his doctor was unable to explain how a partially blind child could draw beautiful scenery at a distance that he couldn’t see. </p>

          <p>“He never learned design, but he just communicates when you see him with gestures, by doing things and by drawing what he wants,” Professor Harry said.</p>
          <p>As a child born partially blind and deaf, James performs well in various aspects. Professor Harry said that James didn’t have a bad temper and never complained that life is unfair to him. According to his mother, although he would show frustration sometimes, he never showed it at school. </p>
          <p>Professor Harry credits James’ excellent behaviors to the mother, Gwenie Gomez-James, who never abandoned her child.</p>
          <p>“It is hard to raise a child who is deaf and can't speak at the same time, but we always found ways,” Jame’s sister, Jovita wrote on Facebook. </p>
          <p>Despite James’ deafness and blindness, Gwenie treated James as an ordinary child. She taught him the same rules of life as she taught other three children in their family.
            Professor Harry shares the same birthday with James. “I love this child since I saw him for the first time,” she said. “I think there is a special connection between James and me.” </p>
          <p>Selris James is unfortunate because his disability deprives his ability to see beautiful colors and hear wonderful melodies. </p>
          <p>But, at the same time, Selris James is fortunate because life has endowed him with artistic talents. He has a great mother who has always taken care of him, a nice teacher who has always wanted to do something better for him, a kind doctor who offered him free surgery, and lots of strangers who always encourage him on Facebook.</p>
